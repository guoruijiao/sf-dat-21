    "- Statistics and Visualization with `pandas`\n",

However, the skills you've learned so far will prove to be very fruitful as a data scientist (e.g., mastering tidying data will save you hours of time and make your data much easier to work on).  This lab gives you an opportunity to put into practice all these concepts."

    "3. At some point in time, you may want to split tidying up the dataset and the exploratory data analysis into different notebooks (multiple well defined notebooks make it easier to collaborate).  You could save your cleaned up dataset into disk (it should be small at this point) and load it from the other notebook.\n",
    "4. If time allows, create a new tidy dataset reporting fatalities, injuries, and property/crop damage (min, max, median, Q1, Q3, mean, and variance) per calendar year and per state and save it as a CSV file."
